In this post I'll be covering how to install an Arch VM on QEMU/KVM. I'm using **Fedora** 37 system, so some of the following instructions are **only for fedora**.

## Prerequesites

Run this command to check if you have virtualization module on your computer.

```
egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
```

 As long as the result is bigger than 0, you are able to run VMs.

> If the result is 0, go into BIOS and enable virtualization.


## Installing QEMU/KVM

In Fedora, run this command to install every tools for KVM.

```
sudo dnf install @virtualization
```

Next, we'll start the libvirt daemon service.

```
sudo systemctl start libvertd
```

Command it to start at boot.

```
sudo systemctl enable libvertd
```

And we're all set for QEMU/KVM! We'll be managing our VMs in the Virt-Manager App.

## Installing Arch

### Download

There's a page about [downloading Arch](https://archlinux.org/download/) in the [Arch Wiki](https://archlinux.org/). It is recommended to look up the page and choose a way you like to download Arch.

I personally download it through BitTorrent. 

First install `transmission-cli`.

```
sudo dnf install transmission-cli
```

Then download the `.torrent` file from the BitTorrent section in the [download page](https://archlinux.org/download/).

Next, download the `.iso` file from the `.torrent` file

```
transmission-cli /path/to/torrent.iso.torrent
```

Once the `.iso` file is downloaded, our next step is to create a VM in `Virt-Manager`.

### Create VM in Virt-Manager

1. Open `Virtual Machine Manager`
2. Click the `+` button to create new VM
3. Choose `Local Install Media`
4. Choose the `.iso` file. Check if Virt-Manager detects the OS of the `.iso` file
5. Set memory and CPU *(My setup: 2048 MiB memory and 2 CPU)*
6. Set storage *(My setup: 20 GiB)*
7. Set name

Press `Finish`, and `Virt-Manager` would create and start Arch for you. Now it's time to install it.

### Installation

There is also a page covering the [installation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) of Arch. Please go to the page and follow every step to install Arch. The following section will be notes for the installation guide.

#### 1.6

Checking boot mode (`BIOS` or `EFI`)

```
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
```

#### 1.7

If your computer is connected to the internet, your VM should do fine.

Run `ping` to check network availability.

```
ping archlinux.org
```

#### 1.8

List all timezones to choose.

```
timedatectl list-timezone
```

Set your timezone.

```
timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Taipei
```

#### 1.9 

The installation guide provides `GPT` and `MBR` partition table to choose. Your choice depends on the boot mode. Check your boot mode first in section 1.6 .

{/* | Boot Mode | Partition Table | <br />
| --------- | --------------- | <br />
| BIOS      | MBR             | <br />
| EFI       | GPT             | <br /> */}

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Boot Mode
        </th>
        <th>
            Partition Table
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            BIOS
        </td>
        <td>
            MBR
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            EFI
        </td>
        <td>
            GPT
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


 Use `fdisk` to partition hardisk.
 
 ```
 // list hardisk
 fdisk -l
 
 // partition hardisk (In my case, /dev/vda)
 fdisk /dev/vda
 ```
 
 The following is how I partitioned (based on MBR table):


{/* | Partition | Type     | Number | First Sector | Last Sector | <br />
| --------- | -------- | ------ | ------------ | ----------- | <br />
| SWAP      | Primary  | 1      | 2048         | 1050624     | <br />
| root      | Primary  | 2      | 1052672      | 41943039    | <br /> */}

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Partition
        </th>
        <th>
            Type
        </th>
        <th>
            Number
        </th>
        <th>
            First Sector
        </th>
        <th>
            LastSector
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            SWAP
        </td>
        <td>
            Primary
        </td>
        <td>
            1
        </td>
        <td>
            2048
        </td>
        <td>
            1050624
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            root
        </td>
        <td>
            Primary
        </td>
        <td>
            2
        </td>
        <td>
            1052672 
        </td>
        <td>
            41943039
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


> Remember to toggle bootable flag on the root partition. To do so, enter command `a` and select `2`

```
// Some useful command in fdisk
m - help
n - new partition
a - toggle bootable flag
q - quit without saving
w - quit and saving // saving means writing partition to the disk
```


#### 1.10

Format root partition into ext4 file system.

```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/vda2
```

Format SWAP partition into swap

```
mksawp /dev/vda1
```

> If you boot in efi, do `mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/efi_system_partition`

#### 1.11

Mount root partition.

```
mount /dev/vda2 /mnt
```

Setup swap.

```
swapon /dev/vda1
```

Additional mounting points are unecessary.

#### 2.2

Recommended packages to download:

* **base** 
* **linux**

* man-pages
* texinfo
* tldr
* lshw
* **dhcpcd**
* iwd
* neofetch

```

#### 3.1

Generate `fstab` file.

```
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

#### 3.2

Change root into `/mnt`.

```
arch-chroot /mnt
```

#### 3.3

Set timezone.

```
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Taipei /etc/localtime
```

```
hwclock --systohc
```

#### 3.4

Not necessary.

#### 3.5

```
vim /etc/hostname
```

#### 3.6

Not necessary.

#### 3.7

Set root password.

```
passwd
```

#### 3.8

**Important step**

Setup Grub as bootloader so that you can boot into Arch.

> You'll get stuck at booting up if you forget to setup grub
>
```
// if haven't installed grub
exit
pacstrap -K /mnt grub
arch-chroot /mnt
```
Install and make grub config; install on **disk**, not partition

```
grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/vda
```

```
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

#### 4

```
exit

reboot
```

## Post Installation

Now, we should have our Arch successfully installed and running!

Some task we should do after installation:

```
systemctl start dhcpcd.service
```

```
systemctl enable dhcpcd.service
```
